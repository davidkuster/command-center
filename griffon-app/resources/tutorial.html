Welcome to the Grails Command Center utility!  The intent behind this tool is to make Grails development more productive and enjoyable by putting a layer on top of directly interacting with the command line.  This is especially true for those confined to Windows machines and its 1980s-era DOS prompt, but is presumably applicable for anyone who has tired of typing 'grails run-app' for what feels like the 10,000th time.  Note that IDE users will probably not find this helpful, but for those using the fantastic Sublime Text 2 (or something similar) this will hopefully be a worthwhile companion.

<p><b>Tutorial</b></p>

<p>
	This tool comes preloaded with a button configuration for some commonly used Grails commands.  The command buttons can be edited or deleted by right-clicking on them, or a new button can be added via the '*' button.  Commands can also be typed directly into the command combo box and executed by pressing enter.
</p>

<p>
	Note that the combo box will remember any manually entered commands, which can be accessed using the drop-down aspect of the combo box.  The history of these commands can be cleared using the Edit menu.  An option to edit the history (to remove mistyped commands, for instance) is forthcoming.  
</p>

<p>
	Console output can be searched or cleared/wiped via buttons or keystrokes (Ctrl/Cmd-F and Ctrl/Cmd-W, respectively).  In addition, the currently running process can be killed via the 'Stop' button or via a keystoke (Ctrl/Cmd-Q).
</p>

<p>
	Console output can be edited directly in the app to help focus in on key info.  However, note that currently updates to the text area are not reflected back to the internal data representation, so any subsequent output will ignore changes.  However, the updated text can be copied to the system clipboard by highlighting it and using the Copy button or Ctrl/Cmd-C.
</p>

<p>
	Before starting, set the Grails project directory using the menu (Project -> Set Project Directory).  On exit, the tool will automatically write your current config to a hidden file in your home directory (.griffon-command-center), but you can also save and load other config files using the menu.
</p>

<p>
	Additional options can be set using the Preferences -> Project Options menu.  These are:
</p>

<p>
	<b>Command Prefix</b>
	<br>
	The default setting is to assume all commands start with "grails".  However, this can be modified - for instance, I use a script I've named "g.sh" to automatically determine the correct version of Grails to load based on the current project's application.properties file.  If you'd prefer to have more flexibility in the tool this value can be removed and the buttons can be updated from "run-app" to "grails run-app".  Additionally, you can specify the full path to the "grails" script as an alternative way to run multiple Grails versions on the same system.

</p>

<p>
	<b>Console Max Chars</b>
	<br>
	In order to not have the app memory grow continuously, the output is limited to a specified number of characters.  Set this value to 0 to turn off limiting.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Smart Console Output</b>
	<br>
	Grails 2.0 updated its default output to minimize the number of lines written, so "| Compiling 2 source files" and "| Compiling 2 source files..." will be shown on the same line.  This setting is an attempt to mimic that behavior, but can be turned off if desired.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Show Current Command Info in Console</b>
	<br>
	This setting controls whether additional output is written to the console to indicate the current command being run, as well as completion and timing info of that command.  Currently it looks like this:
	<pre>
    --- running 'grails stats' ---
    (normal command output)
    --- command completed in 4108ms (4.11s) (0.07m) ---</pre>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Show Welcome Message at Startup</b>
	<br>
	Pretty self-explanatory.  :)
